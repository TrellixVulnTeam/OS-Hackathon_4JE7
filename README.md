# 2) We will be using Memory management techniques such as best fit to park cars #
# 3) Also to check if the car is Parked we will kick in some CV #
# 4) Other opportunities in smart building will be considered where we need to have security for people #
# 5) Also we will guide the people parking using search algorithm to come out of parking. #
# Search algorithm will be organised with priority for small cars. Thus leading a process scheduling problem #
