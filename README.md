**Smart Buidling**

-  We are trying to build a smart building management
-  Here we can consider car parking as a memory allocation problem. 
-  We will be using Memory management techniques such as best fit to park cars 
-  Also to check if the car is Parked we will kick in some CV 
-  Other opportunities in smart building will be considered where we need to have security for people 
-  Also we will guide the people parking using search algorithm to come out of parking. 
- Search algorithm will be organised with priority for small cars. Thus leading a process scheduling problem.


We will be solving these problems to provide a good implementation for a smart building.
